# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Report

# Aim
The aim of this HR Analytics Dashboard is to provide an in-depth view of employee attrition across various dimensions such as age, education, salary, job role, and years at the company. The dashboard visualizes data to identify patterns and trends in employee turnover, allowing HR departments to develop informed strategies to reduce attrition.

# Objective
a) To analyze employee attrition based on key metrics, including:
  1. Attrition rate
  2. Average age and salary
  3. Job roles most affected by attrition
  4. Attrition by education level, age group, salary range, and tenure
b) To help HR professionals identify trends and factors contributing to employee turnover.
c) To aid in decision-making regarding employee retention and workforce planning.

# Project Learning
Data Visualization: The dashboard demonstrates effective use of visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, and tables to present attrition data in a clear, understandable format. Various visualizations are used to compare attrition across categories such as job roles, education levels, salary slabs, and tenure.

Data-Driven Insights: The ability to extract insights such as the highest attrition rate within specific job roles (e.g., Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive) helps HR teams focus on areas needing attention. The analysis of salary bands and education levels further refines the insights.

Dashboard Design: A clean, intuitive design allows users to quickly grasp key metrics such as the total number of employees, average salary, and attrition rate. Users can also filter data by department (e.g., Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales).

# Analysis

These metrics provide a quick overview of the organizationâ€™s workforce and attrition statistics.

2. Attrition by Education

    Life Sciences: 38% of attrition
    Medical: 25%
    Marketing: 15%
    Technical Degree: 14%
    Other: 5%

The highest attrition is seen among employees with Life Sciences backgrounds, while technical degree holders have a lower rate of attrition.

    26-35 years: The most significant attrition group (111 employees).
    18-25 years: 43 employees.
    36-45 years: 41 employees.
    46-55 years: 26 employees.
    55+ years: 8 employees.

Young to mid-career employees (ages 26-35) are experiencing the highest turnover, indicating that the company may need to focus on retention efforts for this demographic.

4. Attrition by Salary Slab

    Up to 5k: 158 employees.
    5k-10k: 48 employees.
    10k-15k: 18 employees.
    15k+: 5 employees.

A significant portion of attrition occurs in the lowest salary bracket, highlighting a possible correlation between lower pay and higher turnover.

5. Attrition by Years at Company

    0-1 years: 57 employees.
    1-5 years: 16 employees.
    5-10 years: 18 employees.
    10+ years: 16 employees.

The highest attrition happens during the first year of employment, suggesting potential onboarding or job fit issues. However, attrition tends to stabilize after the first year.

6. Attrition by Job Role

    Laboratory Technicians: Highest attrition with 60 employees.
    Sales Executive: 55 employees.
    Research Scientist: 44 employees.
    Sales Representative: 33 employees.

The roles with the highest attrition are concentrated in laboratory, sales, and research functions. This could indicate specific challenges related to these job types, such as workload, job satisfaction, or external market conditions.

7. Gender-Based Attrition

    Male: 136 employees.
    Female: 76 employees.

Attrition is higher among males than females, though the exact percentage split is not provided. It may indicate varying factors influencing employee decisions to leave based on gender.

# Conclusion

The HR Analytics Dashboard reveals several important patterns in employee attrition:
1. Attrition is significantly higher among younger employees and those with fewer years at the company, particularly within specific job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.
2. Life Sciences and Medical education backgrounds have the highest attrition rates, which could signal dissatisfaction or better opportunities in the market.
3. Salary plays a significant role in attrition, as most employees leaving the company are in the lowest pay bracket.

# Recommendations:
1. Conduct a deeper dive into employee satisfaction, especially for roles with high attrition rates (e.g., Laboratory Technicians).
2. Reevaluate compensation structures, particularly for employees in the lowest salary slab.
3. Improve retention strategies for employees in their first year with the company to reduce early turnover.

This analysis can serve as a starting point for HR interventions aimed at reducing attrition and improving overall employee retention.
